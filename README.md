# (Retail) Supplier Restock Request Trigger

This workflow automatically monitors your Shopify inventory, detects low-stock products, generates smart alert messages, logs records in Google Sheets and sends priority-based notifications to Slack.

This workflow checks your Shopify store every 5 hours, identifies products with low inventory (≤10 units), generates professional alert messages using AI, prevents duplicate alerts using Google Sheets, assigns priority based on stock level and notifies your team on Slack.

You receive:

- **Automated inventory checks every 5 hours**
- **Google Sheet tracking for low-stock products**
- **Priority-based Slack alerts (High / Medium / Low)**

Ideal for teams that want proactive inventory visibility without manual stock checks.

### Quick Start – Implementation Steps

1. Connect your **Shopify account** to fetch products and inventory.
2. Connect **OpenAI** to generate alert messages.
3. Connect a **Google Sheet** for tracking alerts.
4. Connect **Slack** to receive notifications.
5. Activate the workflow — monitoring starts automatically.

## What It Does

This workflow automates low-stock monitoring for Shopify products:

1. Runs automatically every 5 hours.
2. Fetches all products and inventory levels from Shopify.
3. Cleans and prepares product data (SKU, name, stock, vendor).
4. Processes products in small batches to avoid overload.
5. Filters only products with stock ≤ 10 units.
6. Generates a professional alert message using AI.
7. Checks Google Sheets to avoid duplicate records.
8. Appends new records or updates existing ones.
9. Assigns priority based on stock level:
   - 2 units → High priority
   - 6 units → Medium priority
   - 10 units → Low priority
10. Sends a clear Slack alert to the team.

This ensures timely restocking with no duplicate alerts.
